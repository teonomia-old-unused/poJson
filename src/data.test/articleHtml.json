We are the Lord’s, and His right to use us and"," togovern us is total. Our creation, and election or reprobation, is of Hissove","reign counsel and choice, not ours. Thus, we have no basis for any validobjecti","on to anything God does. In the famous case of the man executed forgathering fi","rewood on the Sabbath (Num. 15:32-36), it was Gods prerogative todo as He had d","ecreed.

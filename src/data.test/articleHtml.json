We are God’s property byvirtue of creation, and, because of redemption, we are doubly His, “bought witha price.” Hence “we are not(our) own” (I Cor. 6:19-20). We are the Lord’s, and His right to use us and togovern us is total. Our creation, and election or reprobation, is of Hissovereign counsel and choice, not ours. Thus, we have no basis for any validobjection to anything God does. In the famous case of the man executed forgathering firewood on the Sabbath (Num. 15:32-36), it was Gods prerogative todo as He had decreed. We can understand the decision as judgment on apresumptuous sin (Num. 15:30-31); the offender deliberately expressed hiscontempt for God’s law and God’s provision. It was an act of defiance andtreason. However, whether we understand God’s law or not, or whether or not itseems reasonable to us, it is binding upon us, because the reason it rests onis God’s, not man’s.\n  ",

The new moral basis and authority is the word of man, or the word ofthe church or state. By such decisions, men, churches, and states declarethemselves to be gods walking on earth and delivering the new law for man.

It is not only the law which is set aside, but thehistoricity of Scripture, God’s grace, mercy, justice, and love. Everything isre-interpreted by the theologians of surrender to mean as little as possible,to be as little binding as possible, and to be in effect another word, the wordof the theologian in question. The fact of creation becomes a nebulous andnon-historical fact; revelation becomes a historical process whereby man comesto a new insight into himself and the world; and the resurrection becomes animpossible possibility which has nothing to do with the actual resurrection ofthe physical body of Jesus Christ. Consider, for example, this conclusionconcerning the resurrection by Norman Perrin, in a small book of 85 pages,cited as “a help to pastors who proclaim the resurrection message to discoverthe unique resurrection accents of each evangelist.” The resurrectionnarratives are to Perrin not history but literary expressions of theologicalviewpoints.

Indeed, I may go to Calvin, Luther,Augustine, and others, to scholars Christian and non-Christian, for insights,for data, and for learned studies, but when I go to the Bible I must go to hearGod’s marching orders for my life. I cannot treat the Bible as a devotionalmanual designed to give me peace of mind or a “higher plane” of living: it is acommand book which can disturb my peace with its orders, and it tells me that Ican only find peace in obeying the Almighty. The Bible is not an inspirationalbook for my personal edification, nor a book of beautiful thoughts and insightsfor my pleasure. It is the word of the sovereign and Almighty God: I must hearand obey, I must believe and be faithful,\n    because God requires it. I amHis property, and His absolute possession. There can be nothing better thanthat. To be my own property and possession in a meaningless world is theultimate in misery and grief. But when the great and high God, possessor ofheaven and earth (Gen. 14:19, 22), makes me His elect possession by theadoption of grace through Jesus Christ, I must answer to His every enscripturedword, “Speak, LORD, for thy servant heareth” (I Sam. 3:9-10). This is God’scalling and requirement of me, and it is my privilege to hear and obey, for Hisword is life, and it is health (Ps. 119).\n  ",

His\n      Institutes of Biblical Law\n      (1973) began the contemporary theonomy movement which posits the validity of Biblical law as God’s standard of obedience for all. He therefore saw God’s law as the basis of the modern Christian response to the cultural decline, one he attributed to the church’s false view of God’s law being opposed to His grace. This broad Christian response he described as “Christian Reconstruction.” He is credited with igniting the modern Christian school and homeschooling movements in the mid to late 20th century. He also traveled extensively lecturing and serving as an expert witness in numerous court cases regarding religious liberty. Many ministry and educational efforts that continue today, took their philosophical and Biblical roots from his lectures and books.\n    \n      →\n      More by R. J. Rushdoony\n    \n  ",
